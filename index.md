# Features Table

  - Dynamic Computational Graph
    - DyNet builds its computational graph on the fly. This makes variable-input and variable-output models simple to implement with high performance. Learn more.
  - Dynamic Operation Batching
    - DyNet automatically reorganizes operations into batches for maximum performance, without requiring the developer to do so. See our NIPS paper. Learn more.
  - Ideal for Natural Language Processing.
    - DyNet is well-suited for machine translation models. Learn more.
